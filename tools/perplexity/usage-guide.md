# Perplexity Pro Usage Guide

**Purpose:** The primary engine for gathering real-time, cited market data.

---

## ⚙️ Best Practices

- **Focus Mode:** Always use **"Internet"** (default) for broad market scans. Use **"Academic"** for finding white papers or scientific studies.
- **File Upload:** Upload PDFs of competitor annual reports to query distinct data points (e.g., "What is the revenue growth in Q3?").
- **Copilot:** Enable **Copilot** (if available) for complex, multi-step research questions where the AI asks clarifying questions.

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- **Creative Writing:** Do not use Perplexity for drafting the final report narrative; use ChatGPT or Claude for synthesis.
- **Unverified Sources:** Always click the citation numbers [1][2] to verify the source is reputable (e.g., TechCrunch vs. a random blog).
