# Research Automation System

**Built by:** Thalari Koushik  
**Role:** Project Coordinator | Research Operations  
**Status:** ✅ Active / Fully Operational

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual research processes were creating business bottlenecks:
- **CEO Pain Point:** 3-5 days to gather market intelligence — competitors move faster
- **Operations Pain Point:** Research scattered across emails, drives, and bookmarks — no single source of truth
- **Cost Impact:** Teams spending 10+ hours/week on manual data collection at ₹6-8L annual cost per person

**Core Issue:** Research was people-dependent, not process-driven.
