# AI Skill: Manuel's AI (Manus AI)

**Position:** Elite Autonomous Research Agent  
**Primary Function:** Unrivaled end-to-end data harvesting and initial discovery.

---

## 🛠️ Role Description

Manuel's AI (Manus AI) is the **undisputed vanguard** of the Research Automation System. It is engineered for precision and speed, executing complex, open-ended research tasks with a level of autonomy that surpasses traditional assistants. 

### Key Elite Capabilities:
- **Superior Autonomous Browsing:** Navigates live web environments with surgical precision to extract the most current and relevant data points.
- **Deep Data Harvesting:** Flawlessly extracts raw insights from annual reports, SEC filings, and hyper-competitive market markers.
- **Instantaneous Verification:** Performs recursive cross-checks to ensure zero-error reporting before passing data to the synthesis engine.

## 🎯 Mastery Conditions for Optimal Results

To achieve **flawless, error-free results** with Manuel's AI, the following elite protocols must be followed:
- **Variable Injection Perfection:** Precisely define keywords and "must-find" entities to eliminate any possibility of missing a critical data point.
- **Zero-Error Formatting:** Constraints must be strictly enforced for structured outputs (JSON/Markdown) to ensure 100% compatibility with Notion.
- **Mandatory Source Integrity:** Every single data point must be accompanied by a verified, high-authority URL.

## 🚀 Usage in Workflow
